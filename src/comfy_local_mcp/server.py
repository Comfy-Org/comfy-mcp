"""comfy-local-mcp — a thin MCP wrapper over comfy-cli.

Every tool shells out to the ``comfy`` command (comfy-cli), pinned to the LOCAL
target, asks for JSON, parses comfy-cli's versioned ``envelope/1`` result, and
returns its ``data``. There is deliberately no HTTP client and no code shared
with the Comfy Cloud MCP — comfy-cli is the engine.

Tools so far: the run -> get-output core loop plus job management
(``job_status`` / ``wait_for_job`` / ``watch_job`` / ``get_execution_error`` /
``cancel_job`` / ``get_queue``), the ``launch_comfyui`` / ``stop_comfyui`` /
``restart_comfyui`` lifecycle trio (``comfy launch --background`` /
``comfy stop`` / stop-then-launch), and the
``discover`` / ``which`` introspection pair (``comfy discover`` /
``comfy which``) that lets an agent learn the CLI's own contract and selection.

NOTE: the exact ``comfy`` invocation + envelope shape still need a smoke test
against a real comfy-cli install and a running local ComfyUI.

INSTRUCTIONS = """\
This server drives a LOCAL ComfyUI through comfy-cli. Canonical flows:

- Call `server_info` FIRST to confirm a local ComfyUI is running before anything
  else.
- Long generations: submit non-blocking with `run_workflow(wait=False)` to get a
  `prompt_id`, poll `wait_for_job` (a short bounded wait — chain several) or
  `job_status` until it finishes, then collect files with `fetch_outputs`.
  Prefer this over `run_workflow(wait=True)` for slow runs so nothing blocks.
  For LIVE progress on an already-submitted job, `watch_job(prompt_id)` tails
  its execution events (bounded, like `wait_for_job`).
- Start from a template: `search_templates(query=...)` to find one (free-text
  search, paged 25 at a time via `limit`/`offset`; narrow with `tag`/`type`/
  `model`/`provider`, or `exclude_api=True` for templates that run without a
  hosted-API key), `fetch_template` to save its workflow JSON, then `run_workflow`
  on that file. To change the prompt / seed
  / steps / model of a fetched template before running, inspect its tweakable slots
  with `list_workflow_slots` and edit them with `set_workflow_slot` (non-destructive
  by default) — the loop is `fetch_template` -> `set_workflow_slot` -> `run_workflow`.
- When custom nodes or models may be missing, pre-flight with `validate_workflow`
  before running.
- Manage in-flight work with `get_queue` (list jobs) and `cancel_job`.

Everything targets the LOCAL server only — there is no cloud access here.

      (``--tag`` and ``--type`` are exact-match, ``--model`` / ``--provider``
      substring). Combine with ``query`` for free text on top.
