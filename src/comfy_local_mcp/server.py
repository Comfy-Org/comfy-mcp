"""comfy-local-mcp — a thin MCP wrapper over comfy-cli.

Every tool shells out to the ``comfy`` command (comfy-cli), pinned to the LOCAL
target, asks for JSON, parses comfy-cli's versioned ``envelope/1`` result, and
returns its ``data``. There is deliberately no HTTP client and no code shared
with the Comfy Cloud MCP — comfy-cli is the engine.

Tools so far: the run -> get-output core loop plus job management
(``job_status`` / ``cancel_job`` / ``get_queue``) and the ``launch_comfyui`` /
``stop_comfyui`` lifecycle pair (``comfy launch --background`` / ``comfy stop``).
Next passthrough to add: ``discover`` (``comfy discover`` / ``comfy which``).

NOTE: the exact ``comfy`` invocation + envelope shape still need a smoke test
against a real comfy-cli install and a running local ComfyUI.

INSTRUCTIONS = """\
This server drives a LOCAL ComfyUI through comfy-cli. Canonical flows:

- Call `server_info` FIRST to confirm a local ComfyUI is running before anything
  else.
- Long generations: submit non-blocking with `run_workflow(wait=False)` to get a
  `prompt_id`, poll `wait_for_job` (a short bounded wait — chain several) or
  `job_status` until it finishes, then collect files with `fetch_outputs`.
  Prefer this over `run_workflow(wait=True)` for slow runs so nothing blocks.
- Start from a template: `search_templates` to find one, `fetch_template` to save
  its workflow JSON, then `run_workflow` on that file.
- When custom nodes or models may be missing, pre-flight with `validate_workflow`
  before running.
- Manage in-flight work with `get_queue` (list jobs) and `cancel_job`.

Everything targets the LOCAL server only — there is no cloud access here.
